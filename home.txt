		1 Deploy My Own Secure Website: Briefly describe the process of deploying your website on AWS. Highlight the security measures you implemented (e.g., user authentication, data encryption). <br>
2 Red Team vs. Blue Team in a Home Lab: Explain how you set up a simulated attack and defense environment in your home lab. Mention the tools you used for each side (red team: penetration testing tools, blue team: security monitoring tools).
<br>

3. Building a Secure E-commerce Platform:

Briefly describe the concept of an e-commerce platform you'd like to build (e.g., focus on a specific niche).
Mention the fullstack technologies you'd use for the front-end and back-end (e.g., a popular e-commerce framework).
Highlight how you'd integrate security best practices throughout the development process:
Secure user authentication and authorization.
Secure payment processing (avoid storing sensitive data like credit card numbers).
Input validation to prevent vulnerabilities like SQL injection.
Regular security audits and penetration testing.
This project showcases both your fullstack development skills and your understanding of security principles in a practical application.
